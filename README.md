# vsABF

**vsABF is a .NET library which provides simple access to header and data from Axon Binary Format (ABF) files**. vsABF is written in C# and is based largely upon the [pyABF project](https://github.com/swharden/pyABF) (a similar library for Python).

This project is in its infancy. To lean more about the ABF file format, visit the [pyABF project](https://github.com/swharden/pyABF).
